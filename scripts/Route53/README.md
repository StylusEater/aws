# AWS Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use to administer 
various AWS environments. 

## Files
* Zone.py - create public hosted zones in Route53 from files under zones/

## TODO
1. Fix generating multiple TXT records for the same TLD
2. Support private hosted zones
3. Support all record types
4. Non key based authentication (use environment credentials)
